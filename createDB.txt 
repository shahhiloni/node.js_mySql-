types of Keys in Mysql 

1. primary key : its a autogenerate, autoIncremented, 
- Primary key never null

2. Foreign Key : A foreign key is a column or group of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. 
- it is used to create a relationship between two tables and maintain data integrity.

Foreign key = connection between tables 

## why we use Foreign key in Mysql 
- to link related data across tables 
- to avoid invalid data 
- to maintain referential integrity
